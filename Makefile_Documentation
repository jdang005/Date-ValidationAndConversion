Language      : Unix make file

Compile/Run   : make all

Description   : This make file is intended to be used on a Unix system with the
                gcc compiler for C99.

Input         : "validateMain.c", "convertMain.c", "datemanip.h", "datemanip.c"
                -These must be located within the same directory as this make
                file.

Output        : {"ValidateMain", "ConvertMain"} - The executable files
                "ValidateMain" and "ConvertMain" will be created.

Process       : First the make file uses gcc to compile both "validateMain.c"
                and "convertMain.c" into the object files "validateMain.o" and
                "convertMain.o". Both object files compile with "datemanip.c".
                Then the make file uses gcc to link each of the object files
                with the header files <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <signal.h>,
                <limits.h>, <string.h>, and "datemanip.h", creating the
                executable files "ValidateMain" and "ConvertMain".
