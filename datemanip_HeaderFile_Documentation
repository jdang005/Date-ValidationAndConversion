Language      : C

Compile/Run   : N/A

Description   : This header file is used to include several libraries, define
                the enumerated type bool and several constants, as well as to
                prototype several functions defined in the convertMain.c,
                validateMain.c, and datemanip.c source code files.

Libraries     : stdio.h  - used for common input/output definitions and
                operations and definitions like fscanf, fprintf, etc.
                stdlib.h - used for the atol(char *) and atoi(char *) functions.
                limits.h - used for INT_MIN and INT_MAX definitions.
                string.h - used for strncpy(char *, char *, size_t).

Definitions   : bool             - simple enumeration boolean type {FALSE, TRUE}
                EXECUTION_STATUS - the execution status of main, (0) is FALSE
                NUM_INIT         - standard initializer for numbers and
                                   characters (0)
                MAX_STR_BUFF     - maximum size for string input, constrained by
                                   the standard size of the unix console
                                   (80)
                FEBRUARY         - February has an extra day during a leap years
                                   so it's useful to know that February is the
                                   2nd month in the year (2)
                ISVALIDDATEERROR - a constant used in the printErrorMessage to
                                   denote that the date being read is not valid
                                   (1)
                IFILEERROR       - a constant used in the printErrorMessage to
                                   denote that the input file is not valid
                                   (2)
                OFILEERROR       - a constant used in the printErrorMessage to
                                   denote that the output file is not valid
                                   (3)
                MONTHSPERYEAR    - the number months in a calendar year (12)

Prototyped    : bool validateCommandInput(int, const char * *);
Functions       void validateStandardInput(int);
                bool isValidDate(char *);
                bool isValidMonth(char *);
                bool isValidDay(char *, char *, char *);
                bool isValidYear(char *);
                bool isLeapYear(char *);
                bool convertDate(char *, char *);
                void printDatesFile();
                int copyChars(char *, const char *, char);
                int getLine(char *);
                void printErrorMessage(int);
